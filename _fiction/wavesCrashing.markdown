In the winters, my skin grows white and pale. In the mirror of the pub bathroom, I notice my olive undertones.
In the summers, my skin is brown and golden. Even five minutes in the sun darkens it. Beige, then tan, then the color of bark.
For the last month, I’ve watched the garden grow wild. The fallow grass becomes pine green. I can sit in the grass and not be seen.
Orange foxes break holes through the fence. A black cat eats the bluebells that glow purple at dusk. The rapeseed blooms, and fields are yellow.
I grab a beer from the fridge and watch your cousins chase the dog through the garden. They have strawberry-blonde hair, pale pink shoes.
The boy falls and scrapes his knee. Black and red. He brushes himself off, acts brave a few moments longer, then runs inside.
The sun sets. The world pink, then blue, then grey. I smoke. Orange and red.
The bodies of the playing children become part of the blackness.
I have never seen viridian.

I have spent my twenties here.
I no longer duck under chain-link fences or hide with you in thickets of birchwood trees.
I no longer find my way in the dark by the reflection of the moon on your shoulders.
Now I hold your arm as I pull you through the busy crowds of Oxford Street.
Now I walk into restaurants and say, “Can we sit at the bar?”
Say, “Two glasses of red.”
I smoke in bed before dinner.
I run to the Tesco on the corner for a bottle of wine and a bag of onions.
I get angry more, I think.
When I talk about living in Massachusetts, I use the past tense.
I make us take the train out to Somerset. I need silence more.
I mean, I like to be reminded of somewhere else.

That June you had obligations.
So I spent my days in Victoria Park.
I was reading the Tractatus then.
You entered through the south gate, checked your phone, walked toward me.
You always carried two canned gin & tonics, which you waved when you thought I had seen you.
You sat down beside me and said things like, “I hear the waves crashing.”
Except, you meant the sound of the wind rushing down the hill, kicking up dead leaves, cigarette butts, a crushed beer can.
I wanted to learn how to use words like that.
But I am still learning to say simple things.
Like my frustrations that we always forewent the formalities and structures that made loving people easier.
That with others, I could not explain you.
And that despite my own selfish wishes, I had to be able to explain you.
So I try, always in a roundabout way, with a story I came up with just the moment before.
Is that right? “I hear the waves crashing.”
That’s a story.
When I am ready, I will write that on my skin.

And how much relief I feel when I meet someone in the pub, or outside the library, or at the gym— someone for whom I need no fictions.
I conjure up no stories.
When the rain begins to fall against the pub window, I say, “I will wait for the rain to pass.”
They say, “I will get us another drink.”
I tell him, “It has been a while since I have believed in the affects of God.”
I tell her, “When I showered, the water smelled like smoke too.”
“There are no fires here,” he says.
“Here, the fog rises from the river,” she says.
“The rain will fall for another hour,” I say.
It will be dark then, but we will not know the difference.

I bike drunk through a crowd of people.
They all have the same face.
They all part for me.
I have never managed very well, saying goodbye to everyone I need to.
I desire the company of others differently.
I feel everything suddenly and all at once, like a sharp rebuke from an otherwise kind friend.
I met your grandfather wearing your father’s coat.
I took three suitcases through Birmingham.
You switched trains there.
I gave you a purple plate I made myself.
You gave me patience.
You told me that “I am the only one who has ever been kind to you.” I was not sure if that was true or not.
In Birmingham New Street, the crowd of people all have the same face.

I go upstairs to call you for dinner.
I find you in the attic bedroom.
I duck below the crossbeam, press my hand against the slanted ceiling as I approach you.
We sit in silence, listening to the taking in of glasses, the putting away of glasses, the sound of people smoking on the porch, your roommate yelling something about the sausages burning on the grill.
A dog barks.
We sit in silence as the thunderstorm rolls in, as rain falls in waves onto the roof and through the open window onto our backs.
Your hands are rougher than mine.
I share with you my brief discovery. You say nothing.
You are upset with me for leaving, I think.
Somehow, I returned with less than I left with.
A missing purple plate.
My black jacket.
“Is the difference between the two moments as fragile as that?” you ask.
“I am only a visitor here,” I say.
That upsets you. I think.
“This is mine, not yours” one of us says.
This moment of silence is all that we will get.
I turn and look out the window toward a thicket of birchwood trees.
People run to and from the grill, laughing, covering food from the rain as they run inside.
There is a structure to it all, I think, looking out the window.
One that I give and know by wanting.
But what good does it do?
Can it describe an attic that is brown and smells of wood and damp and dust?
The yellow light of the sun breaking through the clouds?
The green reflection of leaves in the corner of my eyes?
The red pooling at the bottom of the wine glass on the desk?
The silver line of water running along the gutter?
I have never seen viridian.
