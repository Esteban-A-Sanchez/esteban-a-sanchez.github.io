I am currently an Mphil candidate in [Linguistics, Philology, and Phonetics at the University of Oxford](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk). I work broadly across formal semantics, pragmatics, and the philosophy of language.

I am interested in metaphor as a tool for asking (but not always answering) foundational questions concerning the distinctions between grammar and inference, truth and meaning, discourse and context.

I also am a software engineer with work experience at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/job-categories/software-development) and [UtilityApi](https://utilityapi.com). I enjoy, and have a track record of, building robust high-trafficked distributed softwares in AWS.

You can find various things about me on this website.
