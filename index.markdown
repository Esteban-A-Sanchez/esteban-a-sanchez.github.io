I am a Mphil in [Linguistics, Philology, and Phonetics at the University of Oxford](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk). I work broadly across formal semantics, pragmatics, and the philosophy of language.

I am interested in metaphor as a tool for asking foundational questions concerning the distinctions between grammar and inference, truth and meaning, discourse and context.

You can find various things about me on this website.
