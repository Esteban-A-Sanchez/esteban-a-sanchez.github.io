I am currently an Mphil candidate in Linguistics, Philology, and Phonetics at the University of Oxford. I work broadly across formal semantics, pragmatics, and the philosophy of language.
I am interested in metaphor as a tool for asking (but not always answering) foundational questions concerning the distinctions between grammar and inference, truth conditions and meaning, character and content, discourse and context.
I also am a software engineer with work experience at Amazon and UtilityApi.รง
